# flow-redux-starter

This repository is a simple, personalized starter for projects that use the following technologies:
* React
* Redux
* Babel
* Webpack
* React-Router
* Flow

Alternate branches will exclude Flow and React-Router, to allow more flexibility and reduce dependencies in projects that don't need them.
